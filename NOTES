So the way that app functions is by having a content script scrape and format all the relevent data which is then sent to the background page?
Or should the scraping automatically add to the injected html?
Other issue is that the element loading is dynamic, so I'm going to have to set onload triggers to make sure data is only scraped when relevent elements are loaded.

MUST be a background page in order to be consistent.
Must also redirect in the background to be able to load everything and collect all the info.

Seperate clickable fallback element that they can use if they want to access the page directly. To this end, every grab should also return a link.
Perhaps a tooltip or something that tells them exactly what they're doing.

I want to create the effect of an element sliding out from under another element.
